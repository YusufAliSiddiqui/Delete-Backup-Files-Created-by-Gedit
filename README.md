# Delete-Backup-Files-Created-by-Gedit
Gedit creates backup files on it's own. You can disable the feature, however I find it useful incase I lose my work. However, after I finish the project, I like to delete all of them. This is a simple bashscript that will delete all the ~ backup files in the current directory and it's sub directories.
